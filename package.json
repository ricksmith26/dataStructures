    "In this 1 day sprint you will be implementing 2 data structures that are commonly used in computer science: stacks and queues. You have already learned about one use of stacks: for keeping track of a pile of functions that are in the process of execution. A queue data structure would be useful on occasions where you want to process tasks in the same order as they arrive, such as in a messaging application or a printer queue.",
